AI and Machine Learning setup and resources

ML environment:
There are multiple ways to develop and run machine learning models using a Windows 10 PC:
1. Use a VM (virtual machine) to run a Linux Desktop. Adam Geitgey preconfigured a VM with the most popular tools you will need, including:
* Python 3.5
* OpenCV 3.2 with Python 3 bindings
* dlib 19.9 with Python 3 bindings
* TensorFlow 1.5 for Python 3
* Keras 2 for Python 3
* face_recognition for Python 3 (for playing around with face recognition)
* PyCharm Community Edition already set up and ready to go for all these libraries
* Convenient code examples ready to run, right on the desktop!
